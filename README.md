## üìä Differences Between `type` and `interface` in TypeScript

In TypeScript, both `type` and `interface` are used to describe the shape of data, but there are key differences between them. Below is a clear comparison to understand when and how to use each.

| `type`                                                                                   | `interface`                                                                      |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Alias for any type: objects, primitives, unions, tuples, etc.                            | Defines the structure of an object (blueprint or contract).                      |
| More flexible: supports unions, primitives, tuples, intersections, mapped & conditional types. | Primarily used for object shapes and class contracts.                            |
| Uses the `type` keyword.                                                                  | Uses the `interface` keyword.                                                    |
| Can alias primitives (e.g., `type Name = string`).                                        | Cannot alias primitives (only object-like structures).                           |
| ‚ùå Does **not** support declaration merging.                                              | ‚úÖ Supports declaration merging (interfaces with the same name are merged).       |
| Name conflict causes errors if declared multiple times.                                  | Multiple declarations with the same name are merged seamlessly.                  |
| Cannot be implemented or extended by classes directly (but can be intersected).          | Can be implemented and extended by classes.                                      |
| ‚úÖ Supports unions (e.g., `type A = B \| C`).                                               | ‚ùå Cannot describe union types.                                                   |
| ‚úÖ Supports intersections (e.g., `type A = B & C`).                                        | ‚úÖ Achieved via `extends`.                                                        |
| ‚úÖ Can define primitives, unions, tuples, and objects.                                    | ‚ùå Can only define object-like structures (no primitives or tuples directly).     |

### üöÄ Key Takeaways

- **Use `interface`** when designing object shapes, especially for class-based systems or API contracts.
- **Use `type`** when you need to combine multiple types (unions/intersections) or alias primitives, tuples, or mapped types.
- If you need declaration merging (like adding properties in different places), `interface` is the only option.
- For more **advanced type transformations** (like mapped or conditional types), `type` is more powerful.

### ‚úÖ Example

```ts
// Using type
type UserID = string | number;
type Point = { x: number; y: number };
type Response<T> = { data: T; status: number };

// Using interface
interface Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}
interface Employee extends Person {
  employeeId: string;
}
